Develop the application "Calculator". At the top of the application, you must use two text fields. The first is used to display the previous operations, and the second is used to enter the current number. Both fields should prohibit editing their content via keyboard input.
These fields will be filled in automatically when you click on the corresponding buttons below.
The buttons "0" - "9" add the corresponding digit to the end of the current number. At the same time, checks must be performed that do not allow incorrect input. For example, you cannot enter numbers starting with a zero, after which there is no decimal point.
The "." Button adds (if possible) a decimal point to the current number.
The “/”, “*”, “+”, “-” buttons perform the corresponding operation on the result of the previous operation and the current number. The "=" button calculates the expression and displays the result.
The “CE” button clears the current number.
The “C” button clears the current number and the previous expression. The “<” button clears the last character entered in the current number.
